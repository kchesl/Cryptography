# Cryptography
Cryptography Projects
Two of the projects from cryptography class.
These deal with two simplified modern ciphers.
Decodes the ciphers with given inputs.

Project 2 decodes a ciphertext with calculated frequenceies
and using the dot products to find potential letters.

Project 3 takes an sbox and manipulates the bits to
calculate the distribution of difference from Hoffman 
and entropy calculation.
